## Survey Data

1.  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/chrome_2018-03-09_11-43-15.png)
  + Objectives:
    + Tidy datset
      + Make the data more narrow, i.e. convert each question to a row
    + Analyze the distributions via boxplot

```{r survey-one, results='hide'}
# load datset
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/data/survey_data.csv"

survey <- read_csv(url, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = c("", "NA")) %>%
  tbl_df

# view data
kable(head(survey), caption = "Survey Data", format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

### Tidy our Survey Data
```{r tidy-survey}
survey %<>%
  # gather all of the question columns
  gather(key = "question", value = "response", -ptid) %>%
  # rename ptid
  rename(person_id = ptid) %>%
  # remove Qs from question
  mutate(question = str_replace(question, "Q", "")) %>%
  # sort questions
  arrange(question)

glimpse(survey)

# group the data by question to get the mean for later analysis
grouped_survey <- survey %>%
  group_by(question) %>%
  summarise(meanQ = mean(response), 
            sd = sd(response), 
            abv_mean = sum(response > meanQ),
            prop_abv_mean = abv_mean / n())
```

### Visualize Survey Data
```{r vis-survey}
ggplot(survey, aes(x = question, y = response, color = question)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(survey$response))
```

### Conclusions
```{r}
abv_mean <- survey %>%
  filter(response > mean(response)) %>%
  count

abv_mean/count(survey)

# analyse grouped data
grouped_survey %>%
  filter(meanQ == max(meanQ))

grouped_survey %>%
  filter(prop_abv_mean == max(prop_abv_mean))
```
  * 51.9% of all responses are above the mean of the typical response across all questions
  * Question 8b had the highest mean response value at 3.45
  * Questions 2 and 6e had the highest proportion of responses above their respective means
  
## Time Use Data

2.  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/chrome_2018-03-09_11-40-58.png)
  + Objectives:
    + Tidy datset
      + Make the data more narrow, i.e. convert each activity to a row
    + Analyze how males vs females spend their time
    + Analyze how each countries males and females compare to each other
    
```{r timeuse-one, results="hide"}
# load datset
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/data/time_use.csv"
# rename headers
headers <- c("sex","country","total","personal","sleep","eating","other_personal","work_activities","work_travel","employ_activities","study","school_ex_hw","hw","free_study","household_care","food_mgmt","dish_wash","clean_house","house_upkeep","laundry","ironing","handicraft","gardening","tend_animals","pet_care","dog_walk","construction","shopping","childcare","teaching_child","house_mgmt","leisure_time","org_work","other_household_help","participation","feasts","other_social_life","culture","resting","walking_hiking","outdoor_activities","comp_games","computing","hobbies","reading_books","reading_other","tv_video","radio_music","leisure_other","leisure_travel","work_commute","travel_study","travel_shopping","child_chaperone","travel_other_household","travel_sociallife","travel_misc","misc")

# import into tibble
timeuse <- read_csv(url, col_names = headers, col_types = cols(.default = "c"), na = c("", "NA"), skip = 1) %>%
  tbl_df()

# view data
kable(head(timeuse), caption = "Time Use Data", format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

### Tidy Timeuse Data
```{r tidy-timeuse}
# helper function to get seconds
toMinutes <- function(x) {
  hrs <- str_replace(x, '(\\d+):?(\\d+)', '\\1') %>%
    as.numeric %>%
    multiply_by(60)
  mins <- str_replace(x, '(\\d+):?(\\d+)', '\\2') %>%
    as.numeric
  
  (hrs + mins)
}

# tidy operations
timeuse %<>%
  # select * except total
  select(-total) %>%
  # mutate time columns to covert to minutes
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(personal:misc), toMinutes) %>%
  # gather all time columns
  gather(key = "activity", value = "minutes", -(sex:country), na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  # mutate germany in country column to say only germany
  mutate(country = if_else(str_detect(country, '^(Germany).+'), 'Germany', country))

glimpse(timeuse)
```

### Visualize Time Use Data
```{r vis-timeuse}
sleep <- timeuse %>%
  filter(activity == "sleep")
  
# sleep data by country
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = country, y = minutes)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = sex)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 8)) + 
  labs(title = 'Sleep Data')

# sleep data by sex
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = sex, y = minutes)) +
  geom_col()+ 
  labs(title = 'Sleep Data')
```

### Conclusions
```{r con-timeuse}
# calculate average sleep times for gender
sleep %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(minutes))

# get total sleep times
sleep %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(minutes)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(5)
```
  * On average, women sleep more than men
  * The top 5 countries that sleep the most are Bulgaria, France, Latvia, Spain, and Lithuania
  
## Population Data

3.  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/chrome_2018-03-10_16-12-29.png)
  + Objectives:
    + Tidy datset
      + Make the data more narrow, i.e. convert each year to a row
      + Three columns: Country, Year, Population
    + Analyze growth rate of the past 10 years via line graph

```{r pop-one, results='hide'}
# load datset
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baroncurtin2/data607/master/project2/data/population.csv"

census <- read_csv(url, col_names = TRUE, col_types = NULL, na = c("", "NA")) %>%
  tbl_df

# view data
kable(head(census), caption = "Population Data", format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

### Tidy Population Data
```{r tidy-pop}
exclude_list <- c("World", "Asia & Oceania", "Africa", "Europe", "Central & South America", "North America", "Eurasia", "Middle East")

census %<>%
  # mutate X1 -> country
  rename(country = X1) %>%
  # gather all of the year columns
  gather(key = "year", value = "population", -country) %>%
  # filter aggregate countries
  filter(!(country %in% exclude_list)) %>%
  # replace NA and -- with 0
  mutate(population = if_else(is.na(population) | (population == "--"), 0, as.double(population))) %>%
  # sort by country name
  arrange(country)

glimpse(census)

```

### Visualize Population Data
```{r vis-pop}
# subset data to only contain last 10 years
last10years <- census %>%
  filter(year <= 2010 & year >= 2001) %>%
  # group data
  group_by(country) %>%
  # calculate growth rate
  mutate(growth_rate = (population/lag(population, 1)) - 1)

# top 5 countries by population in 2010
top5countries <- census %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>%
  arrange(desc(population)) %>%
  head(5)

# inner join to only get the top 5 countries' data
top5last10years <- inner_join(last10years, top5countries, by = "country") %>%
  select(1:4) %>%
  rename(year = year.x,
         population = population.x)

# create lineplot of growth rates
ggplot(top5last10years, aes(x = year, y = growth_rate, color = country, group = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

### Conclusions
  * Of the top 5 countries in population, all of the countries except for the US were trending downwards in growth over the course of 10 years
  * India experienced the most consistently highest growth rate over the course of the 10 year span
  * China experienced the lowest growth rate consistently by a wide margin over the 10 year span
